<h1>PS-2.2: Intelligent Web Application Firewall is an open-source, distributed Web Application Firewall (WAF) designed to provide next-generation security against evolving web threats.</h1>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive Learning — ML-based anomaly detection with flexible memory and online learning capabilities</li>
<li>Explainable AI (XAI) — Transparent decision-making with SHAP/LIME for full traceability</li>
<li>Dual-Wall Inspection — Bidirectional protection for both inbound requests and outbound responses</li>
<li>Game Theory-Based Decisions — Probability-based strategy matrix for intelligent threat assessment</li>
<li>SOC Analytics Dashboard — Comprehensive monitoring with RBAC-based access control</li>
<li>Native API Library — Flexible deployment options (on/before/after application layer)</li>
<li>Zero-Day Defense — Goes beyond signature-based detection with advanced ML capabilities</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Target Use Cases</h2>
Enterprise security, DevSecOps, SaaS providers, financial institutions, and incident response teams requiring intelligent, explainable, and adaptive security solutions.

<h2>Core Architecture</h2>
The system combines ML/AI, stratigic matrix, and explainability to address the limitations of traditional static, centralized WAFs that fail against novel and zero-day attacks.
